# Airport-Departure-Delays ✈️ 🕐

## PART ONE
I analyzed a real-world large data set involving flight data and used the advanced features of ggplot to produce graphs of this data. I analyzed the "nycflights13" dataset to determine which day of the week has the longest average delay time and if the delays vary considering airport and weekday.

## PART TWO
Analyzing the large dataset further, I added a graph that displays the Mean Departure Delay (min) of each weekday according to airport. This graph also features error bars that feature a max and min value caluclated from the mean (+/-) std error.
